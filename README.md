# Library Catalog Management System

## Overview

This project, assigned by an organization I am not permitted to disclose and intended to test my ability to learn about and implement their related work, involved creating a Library Catalog Management System as part of an internship. The goal was to develop a small-scale application to manage a library's catalog of books, news articles, and papers.

## Project Description

The task was to build a library catalog management system using the following technologies:
- **React** (Vite framework)
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**

The application is designed to manage catalogs of literature with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. Data is stored locally.

### Key Features

- **User Types**:
  - **Owner**
  - **Employee**

- **User Authentication**:
  - **Signup**: New employees can create accounts.
  - **Login**: Employees and owners can log in to access their respective features.

- **Dashboard**:
  - A simple navigation interface to manage and access different parts of the application.

- **Employee Management**:
  - A screen to view all employees stored in local storage.

- **Catalog Management**:
  - Display and manage catalogs of books, news articles, and papers.
  - Support for CRUD operations and filtering via a search bar.

- **Checkout System**:
  - Allow employees to check out literature to customers, perform CRUD operations on customer data, and filter customers using a search bar.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Basic error messages for login and signup processes to guide users in case of incorrect inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (Vite framework)
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- **Axios** for API calls

## Development Experience

This project marked my first experience with creating a React-based web application and using associated technologies such as Axios for API interactions, the Vite framework, and TailwindCSS. The development process was a valuable learning experience, providing insight into frontend and backend development, as well as real-world application of modern web frameworks.

I have gained significant experience through this project and am looking forward to further feedback and training from the organization to enhance my skills.
